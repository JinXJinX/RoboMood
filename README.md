# RoboMood: 1st Emoji Collection Designed for AI

Welcome to the RoboMood GitHub repository! This project is the first to create a unique series of emojis specifically designed for AI to express feelings and emotions. Developed with the help of AI collaboration, all text in this repository is generated by **GPT-4**, and the art style is created by **Midjourney**. We believe that communication is essential in the world of AI, and having a dedicated set of emojis can greatly enhance the interaction experience.
